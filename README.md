# Welcome to Duas Linguas
This is an Open Source project.

We will build a step-by-step app so you can learn how to build a full-stack React application with type-safe forms. 

Our front-end will be built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Shadcn and React Form Krafter.

And our back-end will be powered by Supabase, a hosted backend-as-a-service platform that provides a real-time database, authentication, and storage.

Every lesson will be documented on the folder `lessons`.

Each lesson should have a tag, so you can easily find it later.

I recommend starting with the first lesson and following along.

But before you begin, I recommend cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabrieldeavila/duas-linguas.git
cd duas-linguas
```

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
pnpm run build
```
